Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here victory is near
The sound will fill the hall bringing power to us all
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky!
Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors
Warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors
Warriors of the world
Many stand against us but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again!
To bring them all destruction suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods we are thunder wind and rain!
There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king first one should be a man
I call them out and charge them all with a life that is a lie
